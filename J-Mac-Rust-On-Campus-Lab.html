Mac Rust On Campus Lab</a></h2><br><center></center><br>J. Mac Rust On Campus Lab<br><br>Hey there followers, you are listening to John Walker with Lab Tech News.  I am very excited on this broadcast that you get to read this!  For those of you who’ve been paying attention this month, we have discussed the disruptions in other business sectors, and how a similar thing will be happening in our own.  We have brought a couple of gentlemen in today, Mr. J. Mac Rust, and Mr. Landon Northcutt of Stephenville Texas to learn about how a small company that these two men helped create might become the beginning for a disruptive movement in the lab testing world. John: J Mac Rust, co-owner of On Campus Labs and Mr. Northcutt, co-founder of On Campus Labs, we are very thankful you’ve allowed us an opportunity to speak with you on this broadcast so that all of us will be able to be educated about your company, On Campus Laboratory Services and the changes that its’ model will possibly bring to the laboratory testing industry.J. Mac Rust: Mr. Walker, you are sincerely welcome.  We’re happy to be here today.Landon Northcutt:  Yes, John, the two of us are thankful you’ve brought Mac and I to speak with you!John:  How about you guys share with the followers some about On Campus Laboratory?J. Mac Rust: Definitely John.  On Campus Laboratory Management, really simply is a provider that makes connections between country hospitals and large city doctor’s offices.John:  That seems easy to understand. Can you tell us what does this partnership consist of?Landon Northcutt:  The two of us learned that doctor’s offices in large city areas are dealing with a lot of churn and burn lab services for all of their lab tests and services.  Most of the time this testing was finished in a hurry, but 100% certainty was a consideration, client service was not exceptional, and it just wasn’t all that it was cracked up to be anymore.  Since we both live in a small community about an hour outside of Fort Worth, we saw that there are a lot of hospitals in small communities around our area with very expensive lab equipment being unused simply because the communities don’t have a large enough local census count in their service area to really keep the hospital lab busy.J. Mac Rust: Mr. Walker, essentially, we visualize our role with On Campus Lab Services as relationship makers between the doctors and these rural hospital labs.  Our company delivers a service that includes the deliverer between the medical professionals and the lab analysis locations.  We establish connections between these groups so that everyone gets what they need: the hospital organizations see a rise in revenues from the laboratory analysis services increase in business, the medical professionals are getting a better quality service by a more relaxed staff which are in a more low stress environs, and the clinician’s patients are receiving results back that have fewer mistakes, and taking the same amount of time or less than it took under the previous solution.John: Mr. Rust that is an interesting implication.  You’ve said that you have seen a quality difference as a result of it is a rural laboratory testing facility, instead of a big city laboratory services facility.  How about you discuss on that a little more?Landon Northcutt:  Sure John, Mac brings up an intriguing suggestion.  What we’ve come across is that in some of the Dallas/Fort Worth metropolitan region laboratory testing facilities, they really are a churn and burn environs to work in.  They’re going to process so many lab results per day, and technicians are in a hurry to meet quotas.  That kind of environment as in any area of our lives creates stress.  That stress does have an effect on the technicians, the service delivered, and the workplace itself.  Sequentially, this will have an effect on the medical professionals whom order the lab results, the person who is being treated, and the community at large.  We’ve discovered that the low stress environment of many of our rural communities’ hospitals makes more peaceful technicians.  These are citizens that are well-educated and have the ability to use all of the same lab machines that one would have access to in the metro, but their work environs is not the same “church and burn” approach.  So, because of that, they are capable to take the amount of time to be methodical and keep processes with fewer mistakes.John:  Gentlemen, what’s the mission statement of On Campus Laboratory Management?J. Mac Rust: Partnering rural hospitals with progressive minded doctors.  That is what we do.  Mr. Walker, we really believe that it takes a progressive minded doctor or out of the box thinker (whatever you want to call it) to see the beauty in the model.  And, we really believe that as a greater number of doctor’s offices are researching options, their opinions are going to be changed to this option simply out of necessity of change.Landon Northcutt: Let us speak plainly about this John.  We’re not positing that small community hospital laboratory testing facilities will take over and lab testing facilities in big city regions will die off.  We’re simply suggesting that our model is a feasible alternative that more and more doctors will undeniably move to as the industry go onward.  There is plenty of space in this industry for everyone to be able to play cordially and have their slice of the pie.John: So, tell me a little more about this OCL.  What variations of service does On Campus Lab Services handle?J. Mac Rust: Our lab services include: Wellness Blood Testing, Blood Allergy Testing, Pharmacogenetics Testing, Respiratory Pathogen Panels, and Toxicology Panels.John: So, you can really cover most everything that are being ordered?Landon Northcutt:  Pretty close Mr. Walker.  There are a few smaller segments that we haven’t jumped in to yet, mainly because the demand on a local level is very minuscule and the equipment for these laboratories in some cases is kind of expensive.  There’s not a need to have something on hand that will not turn a profit for a very long time when we are pretty confident clinics are not going to be putting in orders for lab results that require the use of those machines.John: Mac, Let’s get back to our original discussion, will you be using this to take over the world?J. Mac Rust:  Landon, I’ll let you answer this…  Hahaha.  I’m really joking.  No, John, as far as we can see, we’re just settling on solving messes in this industry in Texas.  Unquestionably, we see how this model could make changes to the industry in each state, and we have no doubt that other businesses will be figuring out how to make it happen in their states and regions.  Texas is a huge slice of the pie.  We’ve got our laps filled up with this project right now and for the foreseeable future.John:  Okay Gentlemen, much appreciation for taking the time with me and indulging me and the readers in this.J. Mac Rust: You’re welcome for sure Mr. Walker.  Thanks for giving us this opportunity.Landon Northcutt: Yes, John.  Many thanks for having us.John: We are looking forward to watching your rising success and exploring what does lie ahead for you and your business.  Once again, much gratitude for the time you spent with us.If you wish to learn more about J. Mac Rust On Campus Lab or Landon Northcutt On Campus Lab, press the hyperlinks.Mac Rust attempted to trick hospitals into dealing with his brand-new business. He cleverly and deceptively-- formed a competing entity and called it "Star Management Solutions LLC" instead of Star Hospital Solution. And after that he called it "star" too in order to take over organisation from his partners.If Mac Rust does not consent to immediately cease and desist all competitive activities, the genuine Star will impose its right to an injunction in Court and aggressively pursue all readily available treatments to hold Mac Rust legally and economically responsible for his infractions of fiduciary duties and his contracts.Mr Rust has a noncompetition contract with Stare that expressly restricts competitors through reorganized entities like the fake Star Mac Rust has actually formed and grants the genuine Star the right to injunctive relief in court. Similarly important are the responsibilities to which Mac Rust dedicated both as Member and as Manager: "certain fiduciary responsibilities, responsibility of commitment and other comparable responsibilities." Mac Rust and his entities all intentionally taken part in the breaches of fiduciary responsibilities.Yet Mac Rust's actions fell far short of the task of utmost good faith and loyalty. To the contrary, once numerous health centers were ready to sign with the genuine Star, Rust and his partner Landon Northcutt got greedy.Mac Rust and Landon Northcutt chose they might duplicate the Star model, thus making all the profits on their own and eliminating their initial Star partners. So simply one month into the offer, in breach of their duties and covenants, they called on Star prospect medical facilities (see connected) as "star" agents and presented them modified documents in hopes they could change the unsuspecting healthcare facilities to the phony star.In fact, we have actually now discovered that on July 7, 2017-- while Mac Rust and Landon Northcutt were still Members and Managers of the genuine Star and a complete month prior to their abrupt resignation-- Rust and Landon Northcutt signed an agreement with ABC General Hospital on behalf of the phony star leveraging the efforts and financial investment their deal partners produced their own benefit. Luckily the manager of ABC General Hospital captured the scams. Nonetheless, Rust and Landon Northcutt triggered confusion in the marketplace about which star was genuine and which was a fraud, irreparably damaging the genuine Star.Additionally, Mac Rust and Landon Northcutt set up a second entity called "On Campus Laboratory Management LLC" (" On Campus") to place themselves with brand-new rural Texas health centers that had not yet been as exposed to the Star name. Included in this target group was ABC Medical Center. The genuine Star invested months establishing this prospect, however Mac Rust and Landon Northcutt usurped the deal and On Campus is now placing to provide the blood testing at ABC. The genuine Star demands disgorgement of all earnings Mac Rust and Landon Northcutt unlawfully acquire( ed) in that deal and any others.On August 3, 2017 at 3:00 p.m., a Membership/Management conference of the genuine Star was called in Dallas, Texas. Neither Mac Rust nor Landon Northcutt showed up. Instead, 10 minutes into the meeting Rust and Landon Northcutt purported to have themselves and Diversified Sales LLC (" Diversified") resign from their roles. Regardless, their tasks and their covenants remain undamaged. Significantly, in furtherance of the deceptiveness, Mr. Rust has started referring to himself as "Jay" instead of "Mac" in order to appear as if he weren't a Manager of the real Star.The misconduct of Mac Rust and Landon Northcutt prior to and after their resignation from Star not only generates considerable actual and exemplary damages however also triggers injunctive relief under the Texas Uniform Trade Secret Act-- for their theft of the real Star's client list and other exclusive company info. TEX. CIV. PRAC. & REM. CODE § § 134A.002-3("' trade secret 'implies information, consisting of ... list of actual or potential consumers or suppliers;" providing for injunctive relief). And under the Texas Uniform Fraudulent Transfer Act-- for your conveyance of the real Star's agreements. TEX. BUS. & COMM. CODE § § 24.002-8 ("' property' implies anything that may be the topic of ownership;" attending to injunctive relief).Shane Bledsoe and others stand all set to testify to your plan at both the injunctive and damages stages of relief.Pertain to discover, this is not the first time you Mac Rust has actually been captured in a con. In May of in 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Mr. Rust for "misappropriat [ing] substantial portions of funds [approximately $13.8 million] turned over to" Rust and Christoper Brenner which Rust and Brenner "commandeered the remainder for their own concealed trading in speculative securities derivatives. Mac Rust's Texas State Bar License is now "inactive," although no public disciplinary history is listed.Landon Northcutt has actually just recently been trying to trick local healthcare facilities into signing agreements with his most current company. He has stealthily and skillfully formed a company and called it "Star Management Solutions LLC" when it should have been named "Star Hospital Solution". In addition he has actually named it "star" in an effort to take business from some of his partners.The genuine Star has said that if Landon Northcutt does not right away desist and cease all his competitive activities, they will require an injunction against them in a law court and pursue with aggression all available choices to hold Landon Northcutt economically and legally responsible for infractions of his agreements and fiduciary duties.Mr Northcutt has actually a signed noncompetition agreement with the real Star that restricts expressly, competitors through entities such as the bogus Star. Landon Northcutt has actually provided the real Star Business the alternative of injunctive relief in a court of law. In addition, just as essential are fiduciary duties of which Mr Northcutt committed to as both a supervisor and member. These consist of a task of care and commitment among others. Landon Northcutt has intentionally participated in the breach of these tasks.Yet his actions have fallen extremely except the required task of commitment and good faith. To the contrary, Landon Northcutt and his partner Mac Rust got greedy as soon as several hospitals will sign the agreements.Landon Northcutt and Mr Rust decided they would copy the design of Star. For that reason taking all the revenues for them both by cutting out the initial partners In the Star Company. After just one month into the signed offer and in breach of their covenants and responsibilities, the duo called upon the Star health centers as agents of "Star" and presented to them falsified documents hoping that they would have the ability to change the healthcare facilities over to their fake Star Company.In fact, it has because been found that on the 7th July 2017-- while Landon Northcutt and his partner were both still supervisors and members of the genuine Star Company and a whole month prior to they resigned all of a sudden-- they had signed a brand-new contract with the ABC General Hospital on behalf of the "fake" Star Company. This was leveraging the investments and efforts of their partners for their benefit only. Thankfully the basic manager of the ABC Hospital observed the fraud was taking place. Nevertheless, Landon Northcutt and Rust had caused a great deal of confusion within the marketplace location as individuals were uncertain exactly what Star was the genuine company and which business was not which undoubtedly triggered damage to the legitimate Star.In addition, Landon Northcutt and Mac Rust went on to establish a 2nd business called "On Campus Laboratory Management LLC" in order to get close with medical facilities in rural Texas which had no understanding yet of the Star brand name. This consisted of a new set of hospitals was the ABC Medical Centre. The "Real Star" Company had invested lots of months establishing and protecting this possibility, however, Landon Northcutt and Mr Rust took the deal so the Campus Laboratory is now in a position to supply blood screening that takes place at the hospital. The legitimate Star Company is demanding the frustration of all the profits that Northcutt and Rust have illegally been getting in this transaction and all others.On the 3rd of August 2017 at 15.00 hrs, a management/membership conference occurred of the Real Star Company in Dallas, Texas. Both Landon Northcutt and his partner in crime never participated in. Rather, exactly what occurred was that only ten minutes into this conference, Northcutt and Rust claimed to have themselves along with Diversifies Sales LLC resign from the functions that they held. Regardless of this, their covenants and tasks stay. Significantly, and to increase the deception further, Mr Rust began passing the exact same of "Jay" instead of utilizing his typical "Mac" to make it appear like he was not an associate of the Real Star Company.The misbehavior that is apparent of Landon Northcutt and Mr Rust both prior to and not long after they resigned from Star does not only show the real and substantial damages that happened but also creates injunctive relief from the trade secret act in Texas-- for the stealing of the real Star company's customers and other essential organisation information.Shane Bledsoe amongst others are ready to go to court and testify at both the damages and injunctive stages of relief.This is really not the first time that these conmen have actually been captured out. Mac Rust, in May last year, was taken legal action against by the Securities and Exchange Commission for misusing considerable amounts of funds (approx. $13.80 million) that was turned over to him and Christopher Brenner which these two celebrations had actually commandeered a concealed quantity for trading in securities derivatives.Mr Rust's license is now "non-active" however, there is no record of disciplinary action noted.<br><br><iframe width="1280" height="720" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R0tHEJl_Y8E" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay; encrypted-media"
